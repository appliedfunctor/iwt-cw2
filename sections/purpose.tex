\section{The purpose of UPnP}

The purpose of Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) is similar to that of ZeroConf, the technology used in Apple's Bonjour service\cite{encyclopedia-upnp}. UPnP provides easy connectivity between networked Internet Protocol (IP) devices by enabling zero configuration auto discovery and connectivity between them\cite{device-architecture}. 

When a UPnP device is powered on, it automatically attempts to connect to the network, obtain an IP address and then broadcast and receive information about itself and other devices on the network, including the capabilities of what it and others can do\cite{pcworld-upnp}.

The original focus of UPnP was on devices within the home, such as media servers, Airplay devices, printers and security cameras, however the scope has since grown to include connected cars, work and industry\cite{discovery-and-service-layer}.

UPnP brings the benefits that Plug `n' Play has for directly connected devices such as USB sticks to IP networked devices; the ability to connect a new device to the network and have it just work with other connected devices such as PCs and smart phones, without requiring technical configuration and set up before use.
